In this activity, I were tasked with creating a Python-Pandas script for analyzing the financial records of my company. I was provided with a financial dataset in this file: [budget_data.csv](https://github.com/arzuisiktopbas/Automate-Your-Day-Job-with-Python/blob/main/PyBank/budget_data.csv). 
This dataset was composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses.

My task was to create a Python-Pandas script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset.

  * The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

  * The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
